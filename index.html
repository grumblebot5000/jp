        <h1 class="author-name">Joanna Petrone</h1>
        <p class="main-text">
          Joanna Petrone is a writer and teacher. Her essays, articles, and
          profiles have appeared in national publications, in print and online.
          She has over a decade of public school teaching experience. Joanna
          writes most often about education, culture, parenting, money, and the
          ways our intimate decisions intersect with larger cultural and
          political forces. (And yes, she is open to assignments.) A native New
          Yorker, Joanna is raising her children in Californiaâ€™s Bay Area, where
          she has lived for many years. Joanna earned a B.A. in English
          Literature from Stanford University and an M.A. in English Education
          from UC-Berkeley. She is working on a novel about archeology.
